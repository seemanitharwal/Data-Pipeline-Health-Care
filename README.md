# Data-Pipeline-Health-Care
Data pipeline project 

This Python project implements a data pipeline for processing healthcare-related data. It involves loading, cleaning, structuring, merging, and saving the data into MongoDB. The pipeline follows these steps:

  Load raw data from various file formats (CSV, Parquet, Excel) into MongoDB.
  Retrieve data from MongoDB.
  Clean and structure the data for analysis.
  Merge the cleaned and structured data into a unified dataset.
  Save the final merged dataset back to MongoDB.
