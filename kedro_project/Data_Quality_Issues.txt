Data Quality Issues:


1. Patients Table


This table contains information related to patients, such as patient_id, name, age, gender, and other demographic data.

Data Quality Issues:

Missing Data:
    age, gender, or name could be missing for some patients. It is crucial to handle these missing values properly, either by imputing or flagging them for further review.
    Missing or incomplete contact details like phone number, address, or email may make it difficult to communicate with the patient.

Duplicate Records:
    Patients might be accidentally entered multiple times in the system with different identifiers or slight variations in the spelling of their names.
    Duplicate patient_id entries due to data entry errors.

Inconsistent Data:
    Inconsistent formats in names (e.g., "John Doe" vs "john doe" vs "JOHN DOE").
    age might be entered as text in some records (e.g., "25" vs "Twenty-five") or might be inconsistent with the date of birth.
    Missing or inconsistent gender data (e.g., gender could have entries such as "Male", "M", "Female", "F", or even NULL).

Outliers/Errors:
    The age field might have unrealistic values, like negative numbers or an abnormally high age (e.g., 150 years old).
    Invalid values in the gender field (e.g., any entry other than Male/Female or valid alternatives like Non-binary).

Data Integrity:
    There might be mismatches between patient_id and other tables, such as encounter_id or medication_id, if foreign keys are not set up correctly.



2. Encounters Table

The Encounters table contains details about each health encounter (e.g., appointment, visit, consultation) with the fields encounter_id, patient_id, start_time, end_time, etc.

Data Quality Issues:

Missing Data:
    start_time or end_time could be missing. Missing timestamps can cause confusion in the record's timeline.
    Missing patient_id for some encounters, leading to encounters that are not linked to a patient.

Duplicate Records:
    Encounters could be duplicated due to issues in the data entry or system synchronization.

Incorrect Data Formats:
    start_time or end_time might be recorded in inconsistent date formats (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY vs. YYYY-MM-DD).
    The encounter_id might not follow a consistent format or be improperly incremented.

Overlapping or Inconsistent Dates:
    Encounters for the same patient may have overlapping start_time and end_time values (e.g., a patient may be scheduled for two encounters at the same time).
    The end_time should be greater than start_time; any data where end_time is earlier than start_time needs to be reviewed.

Unlinked Data:
    Missing or incorrect foreign keys (e.g., the patient_id might not be correctly linked to the patients table).
    The encounter_id might not be consistently referenced in the Symptoms, Conditions, or Medications tables.


3. Symptoms Table


The Symptoms table contains information about the symptoms observed for a patient, such as symptom_id, patient_id, description, and severity.

Data Quality Issues:

Missing or Incomplete Descriptions:
    Symptoms may have empty or partial description fields, leading to missing or unclear information about what the symptom actually is.
    severity might be missing, or inconsistent (e.g., some records might use a numeric scale while others use a descriptive scale like "Mild", "Moderate", "Severe").

Inconsistent Terminology:
    The same symptom may be described using different terms (e.g., "headache" vs. "migraine" or "fever" vs. "temperature rise").
    Inconsistent severity scale (numeric vs. text-based, e.g., "1" vs. "Mild").

Duplicate Symptoms:
    A symptom may be recorded multiple times for the same patient under different encounter IDs.

Missing Patient Link:
    Some symptoms might be missing the patient_id, making it impossible to link them back to a patient.



4. Conditions Table


The Conditions table contains the diagnosed conditions for each patient, such as condition_id, patient_id, condition_code, and description.

Data Quality Issues:

Missing Data:
    Missing or null condition_code or description. A condition code or diagnosis might be required but is missing, leading to incomplete records.

Code Inconsistencies:
    condition_code might not follow a standardized medical coding system, like ICD-10 codes. It might have partial codes or invalid codes.
    Inconsistent mappings for conditions that overlap in their diagnosis, such as the same condition being represented by different codes in different entries.

Duplicate Conditions:
    A patient might have the same condition entered multiple times under different encounter_id entries, leading to redundancy.

Missing or Inconsistent Patient Link:
    Missing patient_id might result in conditions that aren't linked to any patient, or there could be discrepancies between patient_id in the Patients and Conditions tables.
    
Outdated or Invalid Conditions:
    Old condition codes that no longer apply, or conditions that were misdiagnosed but still recorded.



5. Medications Table


The Medications table contains information about the medications prescribed to the patient, such as medication_id, patient_id, medication_name, dosage, start_date, and end_date.

Data Quality Issues:

Missing Data:
    Missing medication_name, dosage, or start_date. A prescription record without the name of the medication or the dosage information would be incomplete.

Incorrect Dosage:
    Dosages may be recorded in inconsistent units (e.g., "mg", "ml", "tablet", etc.), or may be missing entirely. Additionally, dosages might be out of the expected range.

Overlapping Prescriptions:
    A patient may be prescribed two medications that shouldnâ€™t overlap or are for the same condition but entered as separate records.
    Medications that have overlapping start_date and end_date may indicate that the prescriptions were not handled properly.

Inconsistent Medication Names:
    Variations in spelling or naming of medications (e.g., "Aspirin" vs "acetylsalicylic acid").
    Generic vs brand names (e.g., "Ibuprofen" vs "Advil").
    
Unclear Medication Duration:
    Missing or incorrect end_date may result in medications that appear to be ongoing indefinitely.

Data Integrity Issues:
    Missing links between medications and diagnoses, meaning certain medications are not explicitly tied to a condition, which could confuse the treatment records.
